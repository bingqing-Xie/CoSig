Description: Construct co-expression network for single cell dataset by sample, and perform unsupervised high-dimension SVD to extract the network variation on sample level. Rank highly variable genes signatures (CoSig) in the network along trajectory for the feature of interest and extract co-expression networks on grouped samples centered around the CorSig genes.
